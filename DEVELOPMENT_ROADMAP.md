  - Add error handling and loading states

- [ ] **Project API Integration**
  - Complete project creation/modification API endpoints
  - Implement administrator management backend
  - Add validation and error responses

- [ ] **Site Management APIs**
  - Connect site forms to backend
  - Implement company information storage
  - Add site-company relationship management

### 2. Error Handling & User Feedback
- [ ] **Robust Error Handling**
  - Add try-catch blocks for all API calls
  - Implement user-friendly error messages
  - Add network error recovery mechanisms

- [ ] **Loading States & Feedback**
  - Add loading spinners for form submissions
  - Implement toast notifications for success/error states
  - Add form validation feedback

### 3. UI Polish & Responsiveness
- [ ] **Modal Improvements**
  - Ensure consistent wider modal sizing
  - Improve mobile responsiveness
  - Add proper scroll handling for long forms

- [ ] **Form Layout Optimization**
  - Verify site name/code are on same line
  - Optimize card layouts (less tall, more horizontal)
  - Improve administrator form UX

---

## üöÄ Medium Term Goals (Sprint 2-3 - Next month)

### 4. Monthly Progress Tracking
- [ ] **Progress Entry System**
  - Build monthly progress input forms
  - Implement progress calculation logic
  - Add status evaluation (bon/probl√©matique/critique)

- [ ] **Demobilization Rules Engine**
  - Implement the 4-month evaluation rules
  - Add alert system for progress thresholds
  - Create remobilization workflow

### 5. Alert System
- [ ] **Automated Alerts**
  - Email notifications to administrators
  - Alert for missing monthly data
  - Demobilization warning system
  - Pre-demobilization alerts

### 6. Dashboard & Reporting
- [ ] **Project Dashboard**
  - Overall project health view
  - Site status summaries
  - Progress trends visualization

- [ ] **Monthly Reports**
  - Generate progress reports
  - Export functionality
  - Email report distribution

---

## üîÑ Framework Migration Consideration

### Current State: Next.js + React
- ‚úÖ Working implementation
- ‚úÖ Good component structure
- ‚ùå Doesn't match project rules (Nuxt 4 + Vue)

### Migration Options:
1. **Continue with Next.js** (Recommended for speed)
   - Faster to production
   - Existing code is working
   - Update project rules to match implementation

2. **Migrate to Nuxt 4** (Aligns with original vision)
   - Convert React components to Vue
   - Migrate to Composition API
   - Implement Pinia for state management
   - Use Nuxt-specific features (auto-imports, etc.)

**Recommendation**: Complete core functionality with Next.js, then consider migration if required.

- Error handling covers 90% of edge cases
- UI is responsive on mobile/tablet

### Phase 2 (Medium term)
- Monthly progress tracking functional
- Alert system operational
- Basic reporting available

### Phase 3 (Long term)
- Full demobilization workflow working
- Automated report generation
- Multi-organization support

## üìÖ Estimated Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **Sprint 1** | 2 weeks | API integration, error handling, UI polish |
| **Sprint 2** | 2 weeks | Progress tracking, basic alerts |
| **Sprint 3** | 2 weeks | Dashboard, reporting, demobilization rules |
| **Sprint 4** | 1 week | Testing, documentation, deployment prep |
